tool MVP to add SBOMs.**\\n\\nThis weekend has been a breakthrough\u2014not necessarily in pushing my tools forward for the community, but in expanding my knowledge. I discovered [Refine](https://refine.dev/), and it is honestly a game changer (for a backend developer like me). It lets me scaffold React projects with a robust, reusable architecture, perfect for developers and solopreneurs. Instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel, you get a clean structure right from the start. Combine this with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) in a mono-repo setup, and you\'ve got limitless potential. The combination of these two can redefine how we manage documentation and dashboards in our projects.\\n\\nThat said, I\'m going to dedicate another weekend (and nights) to improving the [airgap bundler](https://k1s.sh/airgap) MVP or **SABOR** (flavor in Spanish, **S**oftware **A**irgap **B**ill **o**f Materials **R**esolver) as I like to call it (check the demo video below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb). I have decided to pivot slightly, the community has given great feedback so far, but after thinking it through, I realized tools like [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) and [Crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md) might already be top choices for many. And while the CLI MVP has gotten positive reception, we all know the problem with CLI tools\u2014they are great until you\'re swimming in flags and options that are impossible to remember.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSo here\'s the new direction: I\'m going to double down on leveraging [SBOMs](https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials). I\'ve started with [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), and later, introduce [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) into the mix. This will add more value, making the tool not just another CLI alternative, but one that builds on transparency and security by integrating software bills of materials into the process. Think of it as creating the ultimate airgap distribution package that\'s not just about bundling images, but about understanding and orchestrating them across multiple environments\u2014whether it is hybrid cloud or airgapped scenarios.\\n\\n**Why an airgap tool?** Because it\'s a critical piece in the puzzle of secure software distribution, and deploying cloud native and Kubernetes clusters in airgapped environments is a common challenge.\\n\\n**Why SBOMs?** They are the key to understanding what is in your software, and they are crucial for security, compliance, and transparency. By integrating SBOMs into the airgap bundler, we\'re not just creating a tool; we\'re creating a movement. A movement towards better software practices, better security, and better collaboration, a **Rebel movement**!\\n\\nNot to mention, that the Kubernetes community is already pushing for SBOMs with [K8s BOM tool](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/bom/), and with the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) from the White House, it\'s clear that SBOMs are the future. So why not start now?\\n\\nIt is clear where the industry is heading, and I want to be at the forefront of it. I want to build tools that are not just useful, but essential. Tools that are not just for the community, but by the community. Tools that are not just for today, but for the future.\\n\\nHere\'s a sneak peek of the new direction:\\n\\n<video width=\\"620\\" autoPlay loop muted>\\n  <source src={airgapDemoURL} type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\nDon\'t worry, though. I\'m not abandoning the CLI. I\'m simply evolving it into something smarter, more intuitive, and community-driven.\\n\\nLet\'s keep this momentum going\u2014together, we\'re building something amazing. Your feedback is crucial, so don\'t hesitate to share your thoughts. Let\'s go, Rebels! \u270a\ud83c\udffb\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates, don\'t forget to subscribe to the [newsletter](https://go.rebelion.la/k1s-news) for the latest news and updates.

A couple of my friends have asked me this, especially considering the variety of things I juggle daily at work. Some have even asked me if I have a twin or a clone, or if I ever sleep. The truth is, I\'m just a regular person who\'s passionate about learning and growing. I\'m always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. \\n\\nHere\'s my secret: I don\'t wait for my employer to invest in my professional growth or pay for certifications. Sure, they might provide some learning resources, but those are often too generic. Real learning requires diving deeper, getting your hands dirty, making mistakes, making big efforts, and sometimes sacrificing things like sleep.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Power of Projects for Professional Growth\\n\\nFor me, projects are the best way to learn something new. Think about an intern who starts knowing almost nothing. They learn from senior colleagues. But when you\'re a senior, you need to find new ways to keep growing. Maybe that\'s through internal gigs at your company or innovation hackathons. The key is to see your projects implemented and released. That\'s real motivation - seeing your ideas come to life.\\n\\n### Learning by Doing to gain Real-world experience\\n\\nI learn by doing. I don\'t just read about things. I try them out. I experiment. I make mistakes. I learn from those mistakes. I try again. I keep trying until I get it right. I don\'t give up. I don\'t get discouraged. I keep going. I keep learning. I keep growing.\\n\\n## Creating \\"Toy Projects\\" \\n\\nTo learn more about specific things, I create \\"toy projects.\\" These are small projects that solve the personal problems I face daily. If I see potential in these projects, I keep improving them, learning more and adding features. The challenge, of course, is switching contexts. At work, I deal with many different problems, so I build different \\"toys\\" and try to connect them like LEGO pieces to create a more robust solution.\\n\\n## Reading and Watching \\n\\nI also read a lot. I read books, articles, and blog posts. Mainly, I listen to podcasts, but listening carefully, and gather information and ideas that connect with my projects. I follow people who inspire me and share their knowledge. I\'m always looking for new ways to learn and grow.\\n\\n## Your Turn \\n\\nWhat about you? How do you grow professionally and learn new things? Share your strategies\u2014I\'d love to hear them!"}]}}')}}]);
