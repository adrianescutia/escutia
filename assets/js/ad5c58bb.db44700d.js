At his company, developers weren\'t confined to just one or two languages; they had to jump between different languages depending on the project. One day, after a code review, a senior Go developer told him:\\n\\n> \\"*You code Go as if you were coding Java.*\\" \ud83d\ude05\\n\\nOof. That hit hard. But it\'s also a perfect illustration of why languages aren\'t interchangeable. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e Different programming languages aren\'t just different syntactically; they embody unique paradigms, styles, and philosophies. What works in one may be an anti-pattern in another. Let\'s dive into why this happens and what it means for the future of Java in a world filled with AI, agents, and enterprise-grade systems.\\n\\n## Why Not All Languages Are Created Equal\\n\\nEvery programming language is born with a purpose. Go was designed for simplicity and concurrency, Python for readability and rapid development, and Java for robustness and maintainability in enterprise environments. However, the problem arises when developers bring the habits of one language into another.\\n\\n![Which language are you coding in](./which-programming-language.svg)\\n\\nThis is why learning a new language isn\'t just about understanding syntax; it\'s about adapting to a different way of thinking. Java developers moving to Go might struggle with Go\'s preference for composition over inheritance, its minimalistic error handling, and the lack of traditional OOP features. Similarly, a Python developer forced into Java might find themselves missing the ease of dynamic typing and concise syntax but will soon appreciate Java\'s strict typing and predictability in large systems.\\n\\n## Python: Great for Beginners, But Not for Everything\\n\\nPython is often hailed as one of the best languages for beginners; and for good reason:\\n\\n\u2705 **Readability:** Its simple, English-like syntax lowers the barrier to entry.  \\n\ud83e\ude84 **Dynamic Typing:** No need to worry about variable declarations.  \\n\ud83d\udcda **Large Community & Libraries:** A wealth of resources available for everything from web development to AI.  \\n\\nBut here\'s the catch; Python is not the best language for everything. While its flexibility is a strength, it also leads to some issues:\\n\\n\ud83c\udf00 **Messy Code & Maintainability:** Since Python allows multiple ways to solve the same problem, different developers may write wildly different code styles, making large projects harder to maintain, understand, and follow up.  \\n\ud83e\udda5 **Performance Concerns:**\xa0Python is interpreted and dynamically typed, so it is significantly slower than compiled languages like Java, Go, or C++.  \\n\ud83d\udcc8 **Scalability Issues:** Python\'s looseness can lead to unintentional bugs and performance bottlenecks in large-scale enterprise applications.  \\n\\nPython has dominated AI and data science not because it\'s the best language for every application but because of its early adoption in these fields, its rich ecosystem of libraries (NumPy, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)), and the fact that AI workloads are largely [GPU-bound](https://opencv.org/blog/pytorch-vs-tensorflow/#h-key-features), making Python\'s CPU performance less of a concern.\\n\\n## The Rise of AI Agents & Java\'s Role\\n\\nWith AI agents flooding the tech landscape, there\'s an opening for other languages to step in. Why? Because AI isn\'t just about training models; it\'s about integrating AI into existing enterprise systems, where Python isn\'t always the best fit.\\n\\nEnter Java. Java has long been a workhorse in enterprise environments, and as AI moves beyond research labs and into production systems, Java\'s strengths shine:\\n\\n\u26d1\ufe0f **Robustness & Maintainability:** Java\'s strict typing and structured design make it ideal for mission-critical applications.  \\n\ud83e\uddbe **Performance & Scalability:** Unlike Python, Java can handle high-load applications with better performance and lower memory overhead.  \\n\ud83d\udccc **Interoperability:** Java is deeply embedded in enterprise systems, making it easier to integrate AI-driven solutions without rewriting everything in Python.  \\n\\n## MCP: A Game Changer for Java\\n\\nOne of the most significant developments for Java\'s future in AI is the MCP (Model Context Protocol, a protocol defined by Anthropic) initiative. Java is now evolving to be:\\n\\n\u2601\ufe0f **More Cloud-Native:** Emphasizing lightweight, scalable applications. See [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/guides/#categories=cloud) and [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud).  \\n\ud83e\udd39\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f **Better Suited for AI & Microservices:** As frameworks like [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) and [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee) evolve, Java can support AI workloads and distributed architectures more efficiently.  \\n\ud83e\udded **A First-Class Citizen in AI & Enterprise Integration:** Java isn\'t just surviving; it\'s thriving in the modern AI era.  \\n\\nThanks to initiatives like MCP, [Quarkus MCP](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-server), [JBash](https://www.jbang.dev), and [Agentico](https://agentico.dev), Java is becoming a more attractive option for AI-driven applications, bridging the gap between AI models and enterprise systems.\\n\\n## What Does This Mean for Java Developers?\\n\\nPython has been considered the go-to language for AI for years, but as AI shifts from R&D to real-world applications, Java is poised to become indispensable. Enterprises need robust, secure, and scalable solutions, and Java offers precisely that.\\n\\n**So, what\'s the takeaway?**\\n\\n![Java Python Balance](./java-python-balance.svg)\\n\\n\ud83e\uddec If you\'re a Java developer, embrace the evolving role of Java in AI and enterprise systems. Learn about MCP, Quarkus, and other AI tools to stay ahead of the curve.\\n\ud83d\udedf If you\'re a polyglot developer, respect the paradigms of each language; don\'t write Go as if it were Java! \ud83d\ude1c  \\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f If you\'re building AI-powered applications, consider the whole picture; Python is great for AI models, but Java might be the right choice for production systems and backend integrations (AI Tools).  \\n\\nWhat do you think? Is Java poised for a new era in AI and enterprise? Or will Python continue to dominate the AI space? Let\'s discuss it!\\n\\nGo Rebels! \u270a\ud83c\udffb"},{"id":"/java-is-powerful-but-aint-easy-to-use","metadata":{"permalink":"/adrian/java-is-powerful-but-aint-easy-to-use","source":"@site/adrian/java-is-powerful-but-aint-easy-to-use.md","title":"Java is Powerful, But Ain\'t Easy to Use","description":"Java is a powerful programming languages, widely used in enterprise applications, and large-scale systems.

Yet, is not known for being beginner-friendly, until JBang comes to the rescue. Let\'s discuss the Love-Hate relationship with Java and how to make it easier to learn and use.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Love-Hate Relationship with Java\\n\\nJava is one of the most powerful programming languages, widely used in enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale systems. Yet, despite its strengths, Java is not exactly known for being beginner-friendly. Even seasoned Java developers acknowledge that the learning curve is steep compared to other modern languages. This is where languages like Python and JavaScript shine\u2014simplicity makes them attractive to new developers.\\n\\n## Why is Java Hard to Learn?\\n\\n### 1. Verbose Syntax\\n\\nCompared to Python, Java requires significantly more code to perform simple tasks. Take printing a string to the console as an example:\\n\\nPython:\\n\\n```python\\nprint(\\"Hello, World!\\")\\n```\\n\\nJava:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        System.out.println(\\"Hello, World!\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis verbosity can be overwhelming for beginners who just want to see their first output without worrying about classes, methods, and boilerplate code.\\n\\n### 2. Complicated Installation and Setup\\n\\nSetting up Java requires installing the Java Development Kit (JDK), setting environment variables, and dealing with compatibility issues. Compare this to Python, which comes pre-installed on most operating systems and is ready to use instantly.\\n\\n### 3. Running and Packaging Programs is Not Intuitive\\n\\nUnlike JavaScript (with `npm` or `bun`) or Python (`pip`), Java lacks a simple package manager for easy dependency management and execution. Running Java programs outside an IDE can be a challenge, requiring explicit compilation (javac) and execution (java) commands.\\n\\n## Making Java Easier: Meet JBang\\n\\nWouldn\'t it be great if Java had an experience similar to `npm`, `pip`, or `bun`? That\'s exactly what [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev) brings to the table. [JBang](https://github.com/jbangdev) simplifies Java development by allowing you to run Java programs **without installing a JDK manually**, managing dependencies effortlessly, and packaging programs into a single executable file.\\n\\n### Installing JBang\\n\\nGetting started with JBang is as easy as running:\\n\\n`curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup`\\n\\nThis eliminates the complex JDK setup process and makes Java more approachable for beginners.\\n\\nOther options to install JBang can be found [here](https://www.jbang.dev/download/).\\n\\n### Creating a JBang Catalog\\n\\nJBang allows you to create a catalog of Java scripts and share them easily:\\n\\n```bash\\njbang init -t jbang-catalog@jbanghub la-rebelion\\ncd la-rebelion\\njbang add alias hello.app:hello:0.1.0\\ngit init\\ngit add .\\ngit commit -m \\"Initial commit\\"\\ngit remote add origin <your-repo-url>\\ngit push -u origin master\\n```\\n\\nWith this setup, external developers can easily install and run your Java programs with:\\n\\n```bash\\njbang app install hello@la-rebelion\\nhello\\n```\\n\\nNo manual JDK installation, no complex packaging\u2014just a single command to get started.\\n\\nThe Future of Java: Simplicity Meets Power\\n\\nJava\'s complexity has long been a barrier for beginners, but tools like JBang are changing the game. By simplifying installation, dependency management, and execution, JBang makes Java more accessible while retaining its power.\\n\\nIf Java wants to compete with the ease of Python and JavaScript, more innovations like JBang are needed. For now, if you\'ve been hesitant to dive into Java due to its complexity, give JBang a try\u2014it might just change your perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\nImage by: [Matias

In this case, you can remove it from the history using an interactive rebase or by resetting the commit that added the file. \\n\\nHere is a method to achieve this:\\n\\nInteractive Rebase\\n\\n**Start Interactive Rebase:**\\n\\nStart an interactive rebase for the last few commits (adjust the number N to include the commit that added the `.env` file).\\n\\n`git rebase -i HEAD~N`\\n\\n**Edit the Commit:**\\n\\nIn the interactive rebase editor, change the command from `pick` to **`edit`** for the commit that added the `.env` file.\\n\\n**Remove the File:**\\n\\nRemove the `.env` file from the commit.\\n\\n```bash\\ngit rm --cached .env\\ngit commit --amend --no-edit\\n```\\n\\n**Continue Rebase:**\\n\\nContinue the rebase process.\\n\\n`git rebase --continue`\\n\\nOoooh my gosh! You have successfully removed the `.env` file from the commit history. \ud83d\ude30\\n\\nIf you pushed the `.env` file to a remote repository, you should consider rotating the credentials and changing the passwords or API keys. It\'s better to be safe than sorry. To remove the file from the commit history in a remote repository, you will need to force push the changes. However, force pushing changes to a remote repository is not recommended if you are working in a team. It can cause conflicts and make it difficult for others to work on the project. There are tools that can help you remove sensitive information from the commit history without force pushing changes. Here are a few tools you can use:\\n\\n* [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).\\n* [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo).\\n* [git-filter-branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch).\\n\\nI hope this helps a little and saves you from a headache.

ReactPlayer from \'react-player\';\\n\\nAI is reshaping the developer landscape, and Java refuses to be left behind. With the introduction of [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) into Java, thanks to the [Quarkus framework](https://quarkus.io/get-started/), developers can now build AI-powered applications with minimal effort. As Max Andersen brilliantly put it in the Quarkus Insights video: \\"*If AI doesn\'t come to Java, Java goes to AI.*\\"\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n\\n<ReactPlayer controls playing={true} muted={true} url=\'https://www.youtube.com/live/qr7ysMrVxMY?si=iCReCBCJslhJvnPN&t=1470\' />\\n\\n## AI is Booming, But Java Has Been Left Behind\\n\\nAI development is exploding across industries, with Python and TypeScript leading the charge. Python has long dominated AI and machine learning due to its rich ecosystem of libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Meanwhile, TypeScript is making strides in AI-powered web applications and serverless environments.\\n\\nHowever, Java\u2014despite being a dominant force in enterprise applications\u2014has largely been on the sidelines of the AI revolution. Many AI frameworks and models are optimized for Python, leaving Java developers with fewer native options for integrating AI into their stacks.\\n\\nNow, that\'s changing.\\n\\n## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?\\n\\nMCP is an emerging protocol that enables applications to interact with AI models using structured context, making AI-driven solutions more predictable and manageable. It simplifies the way developers feed context to AI models and retrieve meaningful responses, leveraging SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport for real-time interaction.\\n\\n### Why is MCP in Java a Big Deal?\\n\\nWith MCP landing in Java via Quarkus, developers can:\\n\\n* Easily integrate AI models into Java applications.\\n* Use annotations to streamline AI interaction.\\n* Expose AI-driven services with SSE transport for real-time responses.\\n* Leverage Quarkus\'s fast startup times and small footprint, making it ideal for AI workloads in cloud and edge environments.\\n\\n## Hands-On: Getting Started with MCP in Java\\n\\nIf you\'re ready to explore this exciting new integration, check out the full [video demo here](https://www.youtube.com/live/qr7ysMrVxMY?si=wAmyCBDAXc7wgzn7); by the day this article is published, I was not able to find the MCP extension in the [Quarkus extension catalog](https://quarkus.io/guides/), but you can dive into the Quarkus MCP Server GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-server) and the Quarkus MCP Servers GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-servers).\\n\\nFor those interested in expanding their AI capabilities even further, Agentico offers additional tooling for AI-powered agents in TypeScript. Learn more about it [here](https://agentico.dev/docs/intro).\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nI\'ll be diving deeper into how MCP can be leveraged for real-world **AI applications in Java**, experimenting with [Agentico](https://agentico.dev/) and Quarkus to see how developers can supercharge their AI projects. Stay tuned for more insights and hands-on examples!\\n\\n\ud83d\ude80 Java meets AI \u2013 let\'s build the future together!

I\'m not a genius by any means and I don\'t have all the answers, but I\'m always driven to push boundaries and solve problems that excite me. Recently, my blog has reached the top 3 search results for Kubernetes in airgap environments; a big win for me, because it means people are finding value in what I\'m sharing.

It\'s been eye-opening, and it\'s motivated me to set some ambitious goals for 2025. I\'m aiming to boost my SSI by 2 points in Industry and 3 points in my Network. It\'s a challenge, but challenges are where growth happens.\\n\\nWhat fuels me? Creating innovative solutions, solving complex problems, and sharing that knowledge with others. I believe in a cycle: create, grow, share, and then start all over again. It\'s about continuous improvement and lifting others up along the way.\\n\\nWhile I don\'t consider myself a salesperson, I know that delivering real technical solutions speaks for itself. This journey isn\'t just about hitting numbers; it\'s about helping others grow and learning together, if I can build a community around that and my personal growth goals, then I\'m on the right track. Let\'s see where 2025 takes us.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nI know it seems like to early to be thinking about 2025, but it\'s never too early to set goals and start working towards them.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nGo boldly, and help others along the way.

Some build features that are \\"nice to have,\\" while others address urgent, pressing issues. The difference? They\'re either a \\"**Vitamin Developer**\\" or a \\"**Painkiller Developer**.\\"\\n\\nIn the startups world, [the term \\"painkiller\\"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgedeeb/2014/07/24/is-your-startup-building-a-vitamin-or-a-painkiller/) is often used to describe a product or service that solves a pressing problem for customers, it is expected to be a **must-have** in order to solve a pain point, while a \\"vitamin\\" is a product or service that is **nice to have**, but not essential, as an example, a painkiller would be a CRM system for a sales team, while a vitamin would be a team chat tool. It\'s something they need, not just something they want. Taking this analogy further, I think that in the tech world, the same concept applies to developers, but **we need both** types if we want to build a successful team less reactive and more proactive.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn every tech team, you\'ll find two types of developers. There are those who are **painkillers**; they fix urgent, high-priority issues, stopping the bleeding when systems go down or bugs impact customers. Then there are the **vitamin developers**; the ones who build long-term solutions that prevent these issues from happening in the first place. Both types are critical for the success of any team, but it\'s the **balance between the two** that creates a high-performing DevOps or IT organization.\\n\\nThis post dives deep into the **vitamin vs. painkiller** analogy, exploring how it applies to developers, DevOps engineers, and IT managers. We\'ll also cover how key cultural values like **failure tolerance, curiosity, chaos under control**, and a **willingness to learn** can transform your team into a powerhouse that not only solves today\'s problems but prevents tomorrow\'s disasters.\\n\\n![Vitamin Developer vs Painkiller Developer](/img/adrian/vitamin-developer-vs-painkiller-developer.webp)\\n> The best outcomes happen when proactive and reactive approaches work hand-in-hand, each informing and strengthening the other.\\n\\n## 1. The Vitamin Developer: Proactive Innovation\\n\\nVitamin developers are the **architects of long-term stability**. They focus on building solutions that make systems more robust, scalable, and easier to maintain. Their work doesn\'t always solve immediate, high-stakes problems. Instead, it acts as a **preventive measure**, ensuring those problems don\'t arise in the first place.\\n\\nIn the world of DevOps, vitamin developers are the ones setting up **automation**, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and introducing tools and frameworks that allow your team to work faster and smarter. They might not always get the spotlight because their work isn\'t as visible as fixing an outage, but they\'re the unsung heroes **who prevent outages from happening at all.**\\n\\n### The Value of Proactive Solutions\\n\\n1. **System Resilience**: Vitamin developers build systems that can handle unexpected load spikes, recover from failures, and operate without constant oversight. \\n2. **Automation**: They prioritize automating repetitive tasks, reducing the risk of human error and freeing up time for more strategic work.\\n3. **Preventive Monitoring**: These developers also set up monitoring and alerting systems, allowing teams to **detect potential issues** before they escalate into full-blown problems.\\n4. **Continuous Improvement**: Vitamin developers are always looking for ways to **improve**; whether it\'s through new tools, better processes, or optimizing existing workflows.\\n5. **Scalability**: They design systems that can grow with the business, ensuring that as your user base expands, your infrastructure can handle the load.\\n6. **Security**: Vitamin developers prioritize security measures, implementing best practices to protect systems from vulnerabilities and attacks.\\n7. **Technical Debt Reduction**: They work to pay down technical debt, refactoring codebases and optimizing systems to reduce the risk of future issues.\\n8. **Innovation**: Vitamin developers are often the ones driving innovation within a team, introducing new technologies and approaches that keep systems ahead of the curve.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. The Painkiller Developer: Reactive Problem Solving\\n\\nPainkiller developers are the **firefighters** of your team. When something goes wrong; whether it\'s an outage, security breach, or a critical bug; they\'re the ones who swoop in to fix things and get systems back online. Their work is **high-stakes and urgent**, and often comes with a lot of pressure.\\n\\nBut without painkiller developers, businesses would grind to a halt during incidents. They thrive in chaos, solving problems quickly and under pressure. Their ability to stay calm and think critically during a crisis is invaluable, especially in today\'s high-availability environments where downtime can cost a company millions.\\n\\n### The Value of Reactive Solutions\\n\\n1. **Incident Response**: Painkiller developers are the first responders in an outage or incident, quickly diagnosing and resolving the issue to minimize downtime.\\n2. **Crisis Management**: They work well under pressure and are skilled at **prioritizing tasks** in high-stress situations, focusing on the most critical problems.\\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Once the immediate issue is fixed, they\'re able to dive into the **root cause** to ensure it doesn\'t happen again.\\n4. **Knowledge of Legacy Systems**: These developers are often well-versed in **legacy systems** and infrastructure, allowing them to troubleshoot deeply embedded issues that others might overlook.\\n5. **On-Call Support**: Painkiller developers are often part of the on-call rotation, ready to respond to incidents at any time of day or night.\\n6. **Quick Fixes**: They\'re skilled at applying **temporary fixes** that restore normal operations, buying time for vitamin developers to implement long-term solutions.\\n7. **Adaptability**: Painkiller developers are adaptable and can switch context quickly, moving from one problem to the next without missing a beat.\\n8. **Customer Focus**: They understand the impact of incidents on customers and are driven to **resolve issues** as quickly as possible to minimize disruption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. The Need for Balance: Why Both Are Critical\\n\\nHere\'s the reality: **You need both types of developers.**\\n\\nPainkiller developers are critical in any environment where uptime is a priority (which, let\'s face it, is every modern business). They keep things running smoothly by **responding to critical issues** in real time. But without vitamin developers, you\'d be stuck in a never-ending cycle of reactive firefighting, never improving the systems or preventing future problems.\\n\\nVitamin developers, on the other hand, are your **long-term strategic thinkers**. They work to build systems that reduce the need for constant intervention. However, without painkillers, they\'d lack the real-time insights that come from managing systems under stress.\\n\\nIt\'s the **balance between proactive and reactive work** that makes a tech team truly successful. Vitamin developers keep you ahead of the curve, while painkiller developers ensure you can respond when things don\'t go according to plan.\\n\\nWhere are you on the vitamin vs. painkiller spectrum? Are you more focused on building long-term solutions that prevent issues, or are you the first to jump in when things go wrong? Recognizing your strengths and areas for growth can help you position yourself as a **well-rounded developer** who can tackle any challenge that comes your way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Culture: The Backbone of High-Performing Teams\\n\\nBuilding a strong team of vitamin and painkiller developers starts with the **right culture**. This isn\'t just about hiring the right people; it\'s about fostering an environment where both types of work are respected and encouraged. Here\'s how the key cultural values play a role:\\n\\n### Failure Tolerance: A Key to Growth\\n\\nIn a culture that values **[failure tolerance](https://hbr.org/2002/08/the-failure-tolerant-leader)**, developers feel safe to take risks. Vitamin developers need this when they\'re experimenting with new tools, frameworks, or approaches that could **improve systems long-term**. Painkiller developers need it when they\'re making fast decisions in the heat of an incident, where not every fix is perfect.\\n\\n- **Failure is Part of the Process**: Teams that allow failure create a **learning environment** where both types of developers can grow. Encourage experimentation and learning from mistakes. With a colleague in my job, we have our private team name: \\"Monkeys with hammer crew,\\" because we are always trying new things and sometimes we break things. But that\'s how we learn. Even Monkeys fall from trees, right? \ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udc12\ud83c\udf33\\n\\n### Curiosity: Driving Continuous Improvement\\n\\n**Curiosity** fuels both types of work. Vitamin developers are constantly asking, *\\"How can we make this better?\\"* Painkiller developers ask, *\\"What caused this problem?\\"* and generate hypotheses to test. By fostering curiosity, you empower your team to not only solve problems but also to **prevent them in the future**.\\n\\n- **Encourage Exploration**: Teams should have the time and resources to **explore new ideas**. Whether it\'s testing out new DevOps tools or running experiments with chaos engineering, curiosity leads to innovation.\\n\\n### Chaos Under Control: A Crucial Balance\\n\\nChaos is inevitable in IT, but the best teams know how to keep it **under control**. Painkiller developers are often the ones managing chaos in real-time, but vitamin developers are the ones who create **structures and processes** to keep that chaos at bay in the future.\\n\\n- **Embrace Controlled Chaos**: Controlled chaos is a powerful driver of innovation. By encouraging teams to **experiment and iterate** even during high-stakes moments, you create resilience.\\n\\n### Willingness to Learn: Adapting to an Evolving Landscape\\n\\nTech evolves quickly. Whether you\'re a painkiller or vitamin developer, you need to have a **willingness to learn**. Painkiller developers need to stay up to date on the latest **incident response techniques** and tools, while vitamin developers need to be constantly learning about **new methods for improving systems**.\\n\\n- **Create a Learning Culture**: Encourage your team to continuously learn. Whether it\'s through formal training, side projects, or internal knowledge sharing, the more your team knows, the better equipped they\'ll be to handle future challenges.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. The Role of Chaos (Under Control)\\n\\n![Role of Chaos under control](./the-role-of-chaos-in-tech-and-devops.webp)\\n\\nIn DevOps, chaos is a given. Systems break, outages happen, and unexpected events throw even the best teams into disarray. However, how your team **handles that chaos** determines its success. Painkiller developers thrive in these situations, quickly diagnosing and resolving issues to restore order.\\n\\nBut here\'s the key: chaos can be **harnessed**. [Chaos engineering](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/chaos-engineering-the-history-principles-and-practice); intentionally introducing failures to test system resilience; is one way vitamin developers bring **order to chaos**. By experimenting with controlled chaos, they can **prevent future issues** and make systems more robust.\\n\\n- **Painkiller\'s Role in Chaos**: They resolve chaos in real-time, applying quick fixes that restore normalcy.\\n- **Vitamin\'s Role in Chaos**: They study that chaos to understand its root cause and implement changes that make future disruptions less likely.\\n\\nBy embracing chaos under control, your team can turn what might seem like a disaster into an opportunity for growth and improvement. Chaos becomes a tool for learning, a way to test systems, and a path to resilience. Talking about tools, the [CNCF Chaos Engineering landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?group=projects-and-products&view-mode=grid&category=Observability+and+Analysis) is a great place to start if you want to learn more about the tools available. Breaking things on purpose is a great way to learn how to fix them when they break on their own, and doing so in a controlled environment is the best way to learn.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Willingness to Learn and Experiment: A Non-Negotiable Trait\\n\\n![Willingness to Learn and Experiment](./willingness-to-learn-developer.webp)\\n> Continous learning and experimentation are key traits that drive innovation and growth.\\n\\nIn an industry where **technology evolves constantly**, a **willingness to learn** is non-negotiable. Developers must continually update their knowledge, whether they\'re tackling incidents in production or working on long-term improvements. Curiosity and experimentation are key traits that drive innovation and growth.\\n\\n- **Experimentation is Key for Vitamin Developers**: Innovation doesn\'t happen without experimentation. Encourage your vitamin developers to try new tools and approaches, even if they don\'t always work. This willingness to experiment leads to breakthroughs that make systems stronger in the long run.\\n\\n- **Painkiller Developers Learn in the Heat of the Moment**: On the flip side, painkiller developers often learn through **on-the-job experiences**, especially when solving time-critical issues. Their real-time problem-solving often leads to insights that can be applied to future projects.\\n\\nBy fostering a culture of learning and experimentation, you create a team that\'s **adaptable, resilient, and always improving**. Whether it\'s through formal training, side projects, or internal knowledge sharing, the more your team knows, the better equipped they\'ll be to handle future challenges.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Continuous Improvement: The Path to Success\\n\\nBoth vitamin and painkiller developers need to focus on **continuous improvement**. Whether it\'s by reducing the frequency of incidents or optimizing processes for faster deployments, both types of developers contribute to a cycle of **iteration and improvement**.\\n\\n### For Painkiller Developers:\\n- **Learning from Failures**: After every incident, conduct a **post-mortem analysis** to identify what went wrong and how to prevent it next time. This process should feed directly into your vitamin developers\' work to improve systems; is a cycle of learning and improvement that benefits the entire team.\\n- **Automating Incident Response**: Look for opportunities to automate repetitive incident response tasks. By creating playbooks and runbooks, you can streamline your response process and reduce the time it takes to resolve issues.\\n\\nTools you can use for this are [PagerDuty Runbook](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/automation/runbook/), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources.html), [OpsGenie](https://www.ops genie.com/), [Squadcast Runbooks](https://www.squadcast.com/product/runbooks), and [xMatters](https://www.xmatters.com/features/incident-response).\\n\\n### For Vitamin Developers:\\n- **Building Resilience**: Continuous improvement is essential to building more resilient systems. This involves refining processes, improving automation, and reducing the number of incidents over time. Regularly iterating on infrastructure, codebases, and workflows ensures that systems become more scalable and fault-tolerant.\\n- **Feedback Loops**: Implement feedback loops between painkiller and vitamin developers. Painkiller developers can share insights from incidents, helping vitamin developers better understand the weaknesses in current systems. This collaboration creates a **cycle of learning and improvement** that benefits the entire team.\\n\\nTools that vitamin developers can use are [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/) from Netflix, [Gremlin](https://www.gremlin.com/), [Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/), and [Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/). These tools allow you to simulate real-world failures in a controlled environment, helping you identify weaknesses and strengthen your systems to prevent incidents in production.\\n\\nBy focusing on continuous improvement, your team can create a culture of **learning, growth, and innovation**. Whether it\'s through post-incident reviews, automation, or feedback loops, the more your team invests in improvement, the stronger your systems will become.\\n\\n## 8. Building a Culture That Supports Both Types of Developers\\n\\nTo truly balance the work of vitamin and painkiller developers, your team culture needs to support both **proactive** and **reactive** mindsets. This starts at the leadership level. Leaders must ensure that both types of work are **valued equally** and that team members feel empowered to contribute in different ways.\\n\\n### Encourage Collaboration\\nOne of the most effective ways to balance vitamin and painkiller developers is through collaboration. Regularly bring the two groups together to share insights, learn from each other, and **cross-pollinate ideas**. Painkiller developers often have deep knowledge of real-world system behavior, which is invaluable for vitamin developers who are building preventive solutions.\\n\\n### Prioritize Knowledge Sharing\\nKnowledge sharing is key to creating a well-rounded team. Ensure that your painkiller developers share post-incident reports and lessons learned, and that your vitamin developers document and communicate system improvements. Create a culture where **knowledge flows freely**, so the team can grow together.\\n\\n### Create Dedicated Time for Proactive Work\\nA common pitfall in many organizations is that reactive work tends to dominate the schedule. When firefighting takes over, vitamin developers may not get the time they need to focus on long-term improvements. To combat this, it\'s crucial to **carve out dedicated time** for proactive work. Whether it\'s through dedicated sprints or designated improvement days, creating space for vitamin work ensures your team isn\'t stuck in reactive mode forever.\\n\\n![Technical Debt Quadrant Model](https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.rebelion.la/img/Tech%20Debt%20Quadrant%20Model.png)\\n> Technical debt is a common challenge for many teams, but it can be managed effectively with the right approach.\\n\\nTake a look at my blog post about the [technical debt quadrant model](https://rebelion.la/technical-debt-quadrant-model/), to learn more about how to manage technical debt and pay it down effectively.\\n\\n### Celebrate Small Wins\\nBoth painkiller and vitamin work can feel like a thankless job at times. Painkiller developers may feel the burnout of constant firefighting, while vitamin developers may get frustrated when their preventive work goes unnoticed. **Celebrate small wins** for both sides of the team. Recognize the quick fixes that resolve incidents, and also highlight the improvements that reduce incidents over time. \\n\\n## 9. Embracing a Growth Mindset for Developers and Managers\\n\\nBoth developers and managers need to embrace a **growth mindset** to support the balance of vitamin and painkiller work. This means being open to learning from mistakes, staying curious about new technologies, and being willing to experiment. A growth mindset fosters **continuous improvement**, allowing teams to evolve and adapt to changing business needs and technological landscapes.\\n\\n### For Managers\\n- **Enable Learning Opportunities**: Encourage your team to attend workshops, conferences, or online courses. Providing time and resources for learning keeps your team **up-to-date** with the latest industry trends and helps vitamin developers stay ahead of potential issues before they arise.\\n\\n- **Be a Role Model**: Demonstrate the importance of both reactive and proactive approaches in your own leadership. Show your team that you value long-term innovation just as much as immediate problem-solving. **Lead by example** by promoting a culture of learning, resilience, and balance.\\n\\n### For Developers\\n- **Curiosity as a Core Value**: Cultivate a **curiosity-driven approach** to your work. For vitamin developers, this means constantly looking for ways to optimize and improve systems. For painkiller developers, curiosity means diving deep into incidents and asking *\\"why\\"* to understand the root cause of problems.\\n\\n- **Adapt to Chaos**: Chaos is inevitable in IT, but how you respond to it matters. Painkiller developers need to **stay calm under pressure**, while vitamin developers should embrace chaos as a tool for learning. Through chaos engineering, they can simulate real-world failures to strengthen systems and prevent incidents.\\n\\n## The Power of Balance\\n\\nAt the core of any successful DevOps or IT team is a **balance** between vitamin and painkiller developers. By building a culture that supports both proactive innovation and reactive problem-solving, you create an environment where your team can **thrive**. Painkiller developers will ensure your systems remain stable in the face of crises, while vitamin developers will build the resilience to prevent future incidents.\\n\\nThe most effective teams don\'t just react to problems; they anticipate them and continuously improve to avoid them altogether. By fostering a culture that values **failure tolerance, curiosity, chaos under control**, and a **willingness to learn**, you set your team up for long-term success. Remember, the **best outcomes** happen when proactive and reactive approaches work hand-in-hand, each informing and strengthening the other.\\n\\nThe best developers are those who can **embrace both mindsets**, but being realistic, what are the customers\' needs and desires? They for sure don\'t want to have a system that is always down, but they also don\'t want to have a system that is always down because of the constant changes.\\n\\nIt\'s not about choosing between a **painkiller** or a **vitamin** mindset; it\'s about embracing both, and recognizing that **together**, they create a more resilient, innovative, and adaptable team.\\n\\nWhat type of developer are you?

It\'s all about learning together and building better solutions.\\n\\n### Popular Topics in Kubernetes Airgap Environments\\n\\nHere are some of the most popular topics we\'ve covered:\\n\\n- [Installing Kubernetes and Docker Offline](https://rebelion.la/install-kubernetes-docker-offline)\\n- [The Easieast Kubernetes Installations Ever](https://rebelion.la/the-easiest-kubernetes-installations-ever) for diffetent Kubernetes distros.\\n- [How to install Kubernetes in airgapped environments without a container runtime](https://rebelion.la/how-to-install-kubernetes-in-airgapped-environments-without-a-container-runtime)\\n\\n![Popular Topics](./popular-content-at-la-rebelion-241020.png)\\n\\n## Let\'s Talk About Your Challenges\\n\\nAs I continue to improve the content and tools, I want to hear from you. Are you facing issues with **Kubernetes in airgap environments**? Or perhaps struggling with **API management** and integration? If so, I\'m eager to help. I\'m developing solutions through my tools at [K1s](https://k1s.sh) and [APICove](https://apicove.com) to address the specific pain points engineers and product managers deal with.\\n\\nHere\'s where you come in: let me know what\'s getting in your way. Whether it\'s managing dependencies, handling upgrades, or creating resilient pipelines in environments with no internet, I want to know. Your challenges fuel the creation of better tools that will make your job easier.\\n\\n## Tools to Watch: K1s and Skope Quest\\n\\nYou\'re likely already familiar with [K1s](https://k1s.sh), which simplifies workflows for **Kubernetes airgap environments**. But I\'m also working on a new tool; [Skope Quest](https://skope.quest); designed to help manage product backlogs, particularly for **software engineers** and **technical product managers**. Think of it as a productivity booster tailored for the challenges we face in cloud-native and DevOps environments.\\n\\nThe journey doesn\'t stop at Kubernetes or APIs. Tools like **Skope Quest** will soon allow you to **manage your projects more efficiently**, whether you\'re working with code or leading a team through complex technical decisions. Stay tuned for its release!\\n\\nThese all are solutions to problems I\'ve faced myself, and I\'m excited to share them with you. I have to disclose that they\'re still in the early stages, and even though some are already helping many, others are still in product discovery mode. But remember, your feedback is crucial to making these tools as effective as possible.\\n\\n## Let\'s Work Together to Make It to #1\\n\\nIt\'s clear that Kubernetes in airgap environments is a space full of challenges and innovation. By working together, we can build a community that not only solves today\'s problems but also shapes the future of how we work in restricted environments. I\'m committed to developing more content and tools that **make your life easier**, and I need your feedback to get there.\\n\\nSo, let\'s keep the conversation going. What are you dealing with right now? How can I help you tackle the roadblocks you\'re facing with **Kubernetes** or **API management**? Let\'s team up, solve these problems together, and get to that number one spot!\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Thank you again** for the support, and stay tuned for more updates.

to time, we run into issues that seem trivial but can be quite frustrating, when VS Code doesn\'t open from WSL, it can be one of those issues and it happens after a Windows update or a VS Code update. Here\'s how to fix it.\\n\\nI recently ran into an issue where I couldn\'t open Visual Studio Code from WSL. I would get the following error:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ code .\\n/c/Users/adria/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/bin/code: 61: /c/Users/adria/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe: Exec format error\\n```\\n\\nRead on to learn how to fix this issue.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis error is due to the fact that the Windows executable is not compatible with the Linux environment. The solution is to create a symbolic link to the Windows executable from the Linux environment. The solution is simple, but it can be frustrating if you don\'t know what to do, eventually, you might end up reinstalling VS Code or even WSL; don\'t do that, I got you covered.\\n\\nHere\'s how to fix it:\\n\\n```bash\\n$  sudo sh -c \'echo :WSLInterop:M::MZ::/init:PF > /usr/lib/binfmt.d/WSLInterop.conf\'\\n[sudo] password for $USER:\\n$  sudo systemctl unmask systemd-binfmt.service\\n$  sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt\\n$  sudo systemctl mask systemd-binfmt.service\\nCreated symlink /etc/systemd/system/systemd-binfmt.service \u2192 /dev/null.\\n$ code .\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s it! You should now be able to open Visual Studio Code from WSL without any issues. If you still have issues, try restarting your WSL session.\\n\\nI hope this helps you fix the issue. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out, [send me a message here](https://go.rebelion.la/contact-us) or on [LinkedIn](https://https//www.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=PEOPLE_FOLLOWS&followMember=adrianescutia).

tool MVP to add SBOMs.**\\n\\nThis weekend has been a breakthrough\u2014not necessarily in pushing my tools forward for the community, but in expanding my knowledge. I discovered [Refine](https://refine.dev/), and it is honestly a game changer (for a backend developer like me). It lets me scaffold React projects with a robust, reusable architecture, perfect for developers and solopreneurs. Instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel, you get a clean structure right from the start. Combine this with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) in a mono-repo setup, and you\'ve got limitless potential. The combination of these two can redefine how we manage documentation and dashboards in our projects.\\n\\nThat said, I\'m going to dedicate another weekend (and nights) to improving the [airgap bundler](https://k1s.sh/airgap) MVP or **SABOR** (flavor in Spanish, **S**oftware **A**irgap **B**ill **o**f Materials **R**esolver) as I like to call it (check the demo video below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb). I have decided to pivot slightly, the community has given great feedback so far, but after thinking it through, I realized tools like [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) and [Crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md) might already be top choices for many. And while the CLI MVP has gotten positive reception, we all know the problem with CLI tools\u2014they are great until you\'re swimming in flags and options that are impossible to remember.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSo here\'s the new direction: I\'m going to double down on leveraging [SBOMs](https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials). I\'ve started with [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), and later, introduce [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) into the mix. This will add more value, making the tool not just another CLI alternative, but one that builds on transparency and security by integrating software bills of materials into the process. Think of it as creating the ultimate airgap distribution package that\'s not just about bundling images, but about understanding and orchestrating them across multiple environments\u2014whether it is hybrid cloud or airgapped scenarios.\\n\\n**Why an airgap tool?** Because it\'s a critical piece in the puzzle of secure software distribution, and deploying cloud native and Kubernetes clusters in airgapped environments is a common challenge.\\n\\n**Why SBOMs?** They are the key to understanding what is in your software, and they are crucial for security, compliance, and transparency. By integrating SBOMs into the airgap bundler, we\'re not just creating a tool; we\'re creating a movement. A movement towards better software practices, better security, and better collaboration, a **Rebel movement**!\\n\\nNot to mention, that the Kubernetes community is already pushing for SBOMs with [K8s BOM tool](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/bom/), and with the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) from the White House, it\'s clear that SBOMs are the future. So why not start now?\\n\\nIt is clear where the industry is heading, and I want to be at the forefront of it. I want to build tools that are not just useful, but essential. Tools that are not just for the community, but by the community. Tools that are not just for today, but for the future.\\n\\nHere\'s a sneak peek of the new direction:\\n\\n<video width=\\"620\\" autoPlay loop muted>\\n  <source src={airgapDemoURL} type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\nDon\'t worry, though. I\'m not abandoning the CLI. I\'m simply evolving it into something smarter, more intuitive, and community-driven.\\n\\nLet\'s keep this momentum going\u2014together, we\'re building something amazing. Your feedback is crucial, so don\'t hesitate to share your thoughts. Let\'s go, Rebels! \u270a\ud83c\udffb\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates, don\'t forget to subscribe to the [newsletter](https://go.rebelion.la/k1s-news) for the latest news and updates. And if you haven\'t already, check out the [airgap bundler](https://k1s.sh/airgap) MVP and let me know what you

A couple of my friends have asked me this, especially considering the variety of things I juggle daily at work. Some have even asked me if I have a twin or a clone, or if I ever sleep. The truth is, I\'m just a regular person who\'s passionate about learning and growing. I\'m always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. \\n\\nHere\'s my secret: I don\'t wait for my employer to invest in my professional growth or pay for certifications. Sure, they might provide some learning resources, but those are often too generic. Real learning requires diving deeper, getting your hands dirty, making mistakes, making big efforts, and sometimes sacrificing things like sleep.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Power of Projects for Professional Growth\\n\\nFor me, projects are the best way to learn something new. Think about an intern who starts knowing almost nothing. They learn from senior colleagues. But when you\'re a senior, you need to find new ways to keep growing. Maybe that\'s through internal gigs at your company or innovation hackathons. The key is to see your projects implemented and released. That\'s real motivation - seeing your ideas come to life.\\n\\n### Learning by Doing to gain Real-world experience\\n\\nI learn by doing. I don\'t just read about things. I try them out. I experiment. I make mistakes. I learn from those mistakes. I try again. I keep trying until I get it right. I don\'t give up. I don\'t get discouraged. I keep going. I keep learning. I keep growing.\\n\\n## Creating \\"Toy Projects\\" \\n\\nTo learn more about specific things, I create \\"toy projects.\\" These are small projects that solve the personal problems I face daily. If I see potential in these projects, I keep improving them, learning more and adding features. The challenge, of course, is switching contexts. At work, I deal with many different problems, so I build different \\"toys\\" and try to connect them like LEGO pieces to create a more robust solution.\\n\\n## Reading and Watching \\n\\nI also read a lot. I read books, articles, and blog posts. Mainly, I listen to podcasts, but listening carefully, and gather information and ideas that connect with my projects. I follow people who inspire me and share their knowledge. I\'m always looking for new ways to learn and grow.\\n\\n## Your Turn \\n\\nWhat about you? How do you grow professionally and learn new things? Share your strategies\u2014I\'d love to hear them!"}]}}')}}]);
