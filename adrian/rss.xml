            <description><![CDATA[How to fix the Exec format error when trying to open VS Code from WSL.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time, we run into issues that seem trivial but can be quite frustrating, when VS Code doesn't open from WSL, it can be one of those issues and it happens after a Windows update or a VS Code update. Here's how to fix it.</p>
<p>I recently ran into an issue where I couldn't open Visual Studio Code from WSL. I would get the following error:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$ code .</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">/c/Users/adria/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/bin/code: 61: /c/Users/adria/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe: Exec format error</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Read on to learn how to fix this issue.</p>
<p>This error is due to the fact that the Windows executable is not compatible with the Linux environment. The solution is to create a symbolic link to the Windows executable from the Linux environment. The solution is simple, but it can be frustrating if you don't know what to do, eventually, you might end up reinstalling VS Code or even WSL; don't do that, I got you covered.</p>
<p>Here's how to fix it:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$  sudo sh -c 'echo :WSLInterop:M::MZ::/init:PF &gt; /usr/lib/binfmt.d/WSLInterop.conf'</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">[sudo] password for $USER:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$  sudo systemctl unmask systemd-binfmt.service</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$  sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$  sudo systemctl mask systemd-binfmt.service</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/systemd-binfmt.service ‚Üí /dev/null.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">$ code .</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>That's it! You should now be able to open Visual Studio Code from WSL without any issues. If you still have issues, try restarting your WSL session.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[In my experiments journey, I discovered Refine, and decided to pivot slightly in the airgap tool MVP with SBOMs, Refine, and Docusaurus.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A slight pivot in the airgap bundler tool MVP to add SBOMs.</strong></p>
<p>This weekend has been a breakthrough‚Äînot necessarily in pushing my tools forward for the community, but in expanding my knowledge. I discovered <a href="https://refine.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refine</a>, and it is honestly a game changer (for a backend developer like me). It lets me scaffold React projects with a robust, reusable architecture, perfect for developers and solopreneurs. Instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel, you get a clean structure right from the start. Combine this with <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a> in a mono-repo setup, and you've got limitless potential. The combination of these two can redefine how we manage documentation and dashboards in our projects.</p>
<p>That said, I'm going to dedicate another weekend (and nights) to improving the <a href="https://k1s.sh/airgap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">airgap bundler</a> MVP or <strong>SABOR</strong> (flavor in Spanish, <strong>S</strong>oftware <strong>A</strong>irgap <strong>B</strong>ill <strong>o</strong>f Materials <strong>R</strong>esolver) as I like to call it (check the demo video below üëáüèª). I have decided to pivot slightly, the community has given great feedback so far, but after thinking it through, I realized tools like <a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skopeo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crane</a> might already be top choices for many. And while the CLI MVP has gotten positive reception, we all know the problem with CLI tools‚Äîthey are great until you're swimming in flags and options that are impossible to remember.</p>
<p>So here's the new direction: I'm going to double down on leveraging <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SBOMs</a>. I've started with <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CycloneDX</a>, and later, introduce <a href="https://spdx.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPDX</a> into the mix. This will add more value, making the tool not just another CLI alternative, but one that builds on transparency and security by integrating software bills of materials into the process. Think of it as creating the ultimate airgap distribution package that's not just about bundling images, but about understanding and orchestrating them across multiple environments‚Äîwhether it is hybrid cloud or airgapped scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Why an airgap tool?</strong> Because it's a critical piece in the puzzle of secure software distribution, and deploying cloud native and Kubernetes clusters in airgapped environments is a common challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Why SBOMs?</strong> They are the key to understanding what is in your software, and they are crucial for security, compliance, and transparency. By integrating SBOMs into the airgap bundler, we're not just creating a tool; we're creating a movement. A movement towards better software practices, better security, and better collaboration, a <strong>Rebel movement</strong>!</p>
<p>Not to mention, that the Kubernetes community is already pushing for SBOMs with <a href="https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/bom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K8s BOM tool</a>, and with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive order</a> from the White House, it's clear that SBOMs are the future. So why not start now?</p>
<p>It is clear where the industry is heading, and I want to be at the forefront of it. I want to build tools that are not just useful, but essential. Tools that are not just for the community, but by the community. Tools that are not just for today, but for the future.</p>
<p>Here's a sneak peek of the new direction:</p>
<video width="620" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""><source src="/assets/medias/k1s-airgap-bundler-demo-s-1ae3e7b6e52f59990ab6ab050da6c799.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p></video>
<p>Don't worry, though. I'm not abandoning the CLI. I'm simply evolving it into something smarter, more intuitive, and community-driven.</p>
<p>Let's keep this momentum going‚Äîtogether, we're building something amazing. Your feedback is crucial, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts. Let's go, Rebels! ‚úäüèª</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered how some people seem to know so much about so many different topics and tools? A couple of my friends have asked me this, especially considering the variety of things I juggle daily at work. Some have even asked me if I have a twin or a clone, or if I ever sleep. The truth is, I'm just a regular person who's passionate about learning and growing. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>Here's my secret: I don't wait for my employer to invest in my professional growth or pay for certifications. Sure, they might provide some learning resources, but those are often too generic. Real learning requires diving deeper, getting your hands dirty, making mistakes, making big efforts, and sometimes sacrificing things like sleep.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-projects-for-professional-growth">The Power of Projects for Professional Growth<a href="https://escutia.me/adrian/strategies-for-continuous-learning-and-professional-growth#the-power-of-projects-for-professional-growth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Power of Projects for Professional Growth" title="Direct link to The Power of Projects for Professional Growth">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>For me, projects are the best way to learn something new. Think about an intern who starts knowing almost nothing. They learn from senior colleagues. But when you're a senior, you need to find new ways to keep growing. Maybe that's through internal gigs at your company or innovation hackathons. The key is to see your projects implemented and released. That's real motivation - seeing your ideas come to life.</p>

<p>I learn by doing. I don't just read about things. I try them out. I experiment. I make mistakes. I learn from those mistakes. I try again. I keep trying until I get it right. I don't give up. I don't get discouraged. I keep going. I keep learning. I keep growing.</p>

<p>To learn more about specific things, I create "toy projects." These are small projects that solve the personal problems I face daily. If I see potential in these projects, I keep improving them, learning more and adding features. The challenge, of course, is switching contexts. At work, I deal with many different problems, so I build different "toys" and try to connect them like LEGO pieces to create a more robust solution.</p>

<p>I also read a lot. I read books, articles, and blog posts. Mainly, I listen to podcasts, but listening carefully, and gather information and ideas that connect with my projects. I follow people who inspire me and share their knowledge. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow.</p>
