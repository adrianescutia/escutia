## Setting Bold Goals for 2025: My Journey of Growth and Knowledge Sharing

I've never aimed to be the smartest person in the room. I'm not a genius by any means and I don't have all the answers, but I'm always driven to push boundaries and solve problems that excite me. Recently, my blog has reached the top 3 search results for Kubernetes in airgap environments; a big win for me, because it means people are finding value in what I'm sharing. But, of course, I'm aiming even higher for that number one spot!

On the LinkedIn front, I just discovered the **Social Selling Index (SSI)**, which feels a bit like the SEO world of LinkedIn. It's been eye-opening, and it's motivated me to set some ambitious goals for 2025. I'm aiming to boost my SSI by 2 points in Industry and 3 points in my Network. It's a challenge, but challenges are where growth happens.

What fuels me? Creating innovative solutions, solving complex problems, and sharing that knowledge with others. I believe in a cycle: create, grow, share, and then start all over again. It's about continuous improvement and lifting others up along the way.

While I don't consider myself a salesperson, I know that delivering real technical solutions speaks for itself. This journey isn't just about hitting numbers; it's about helping others grow and learning together, if I can build a community around that and my personal growth goals, then I'm on the right track. Let's see where 2025 takes us.

::: tip

I know it seems like to early to be thinking about 2025, but it's never too early to set goals and start working towards them.

Go boldly, and help others along the way. Go Rebels! ‚úäüèª
